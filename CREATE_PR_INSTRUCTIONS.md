## 🎯 Key Points to Highlight

When creating the PR, emphasize:
- ✅ **Dark mode** is fully functional with persistence

- ✅ **No fake statistics** - honest messaging throughout
- ✅ **All tests pass** - production build works without errors

## 💡 Additional Notes

If you encounter merge conflicts:
1. Use the `auto-resolve-ui-conflicts.sh` script we created
2. Or manually resolve by keeping your version (it's more complete)
3. The conflicts are mainly "add/add" conflicts where both branches created the same files
