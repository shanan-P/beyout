2. Use `npm run dev` from root to run both frontend and backend
3. Database migrations are in `/database/migrations`
4. Environment variables are documented in `.env.example`
5. Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions

This project provides a solid foundation for building a comprehensive educational platform with modern web technologies and best practices.
