When you see conflicts:
1. For each conflicting file, open it in your editor
2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<< HEAD
3. In most cases, keep YOUR version (below =======)
4. Remove all conflict markers
5. Save the file
6. Run: git add <filename>
7. Run: git rebase --continue

For the UI improvement files, generally:
- Keep YOUR version (it's more complete)
- Only merge if main has specific functionality you need

Common commands during rebase:
- git status                    # See which files have conflicts
- git diff                      # See conflict details  
- git add <file>               # Mark file as resolved
- git rebase --continue        # Continue after resolving
- git rebase --abort           # Abort if something goes wrong

After successful rebase:
- git push --force-with-lease origin cursor/enhance-ui-design-and-add-night-mode-7ede
