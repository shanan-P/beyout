# Resolving Auto-Merge Issues in Pull Requests

## Current Situation
Your branch `cursor/enhance-ui-design-and-add-night-mode-7ede` has conflicts with the main branch because the same files were modified in both branches.

## Common Causes of Auto-Merge Failures

1. **Concurrent Changes**: Multiple developers modified the same files
2. **Outdated Branch**: Your branch was created from an older version of main
3. **Conflicting File Changes**: Same lines of code were changed differently

## Resolution Strategies

### Option 1: Rebase Your Branch (Recommended for Clean History)

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin main

# 2. Start interactive rebase
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Resolve conflicts if they appear
# For each conflicting file:
# - Edit the file to resolve conflicts
# - Remove conflict markers (<<<<<<, ======, >>>>>>)
# - Stage the resolved file
git add <resolved-file>

# 4. Continue rebase
git rebase --continue

# 5. Force push to update your branch
git push --force-with-lease origin cursor/enhance-ui-design-and-add-night-mode-7ede
```

### Option 2: Merge Main into Your Branch

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest changes
git fetch origin main

# 2. Merge main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# 3. Resolve conflicts
# Edit conflicting files and remove conflict markers
git add <resolved-files>

# 4. Complete the merge
git commit

# 5. Push the merge
git push origin cursor/enhance-ui-design-and-add-night-mode-7ede
```

### Option 3: Create a New Branch with Cherry-Pick

```bash
# 1. Create new branch from latest main
git checkout -b cursor/ui-improvements-v2 origin/main

# 2. Cherry-pick your commit
git cherry-pick c221571

# 3. Resolve any conflicts
git add <resolved-files>
git cherry-pick --continue

# 4. Push new branch
git push origin cursor/ui-improvements-v2
```

## Conflict Resolution Tips

### When Resolving Conflicts:

1. **Understand Both Changes**: Review what was changed in both versions
2. **Preserve Functionality**: Ensure both sets of changes work together
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Run the application after resolving conflicts

### Common Conflict Patterns:

```diff
<<<<<<< HEAD (main branch version)
const Component = () => {
  return <div>Main branch version</div>
}
=======
const Component = () => {
  return <div>Your branch version</div>
}
>>>>>>> your-branch
```

### Resolution Example:
```javascript
// Combine both changes logically
const Component = () => {
  return <div>Combined version with both features</div>
}
```

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Keep Branch Updated**: Regularly sync with main branch
   ```bash
   git fetch origin main
   git rebase origin/main
   ```

2. **Smaller PRs**: Make smaller, focused changes
3. **Communicate**: Coordinate with team about file modifications
4. **Use Feature Flags**: For large changes, use feature flags to merge safely

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check merge conflicts without merging
git merge --no-commit --no-ff origin/main

# Abort merge if things go wrong
git merge --abort

# Check which files have conflicts
git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U

# View conflict details
git diff

# After resolving, verify changes
git diff --staged
```

## For Your Specific Case

Since many UI component files were changed in both branches, you'll need to:

1. Carefully merge the component changes
2. Ensure dark mode functionality is preserved
3. Verify all new pages work correctly
4. Test the complete UI flow

## Next Steps

1. Choose a resolution strategy (rebase recommended)
2. Resolve conflicts carefully, preserving both sets of changes
3. Test the application thoroughly
4. Update the pull request
